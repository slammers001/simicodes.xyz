## Current WEB APPS:
### Stickee
* For more info on Stickee, visit https://www.simicodes.xyz/stickee/info
* Stickee - [stickee.simicodes.xyz](stickee.simicodes.xyz) @v1.1.0 (image below shows v0.0.3)
* https://www.simicodes.xyz/web-apps/stickee is the wrong link. The updated one is https://stickee.simicodes.xyz
* Looks great (and works!) as a mobile app. (Updated mobile css rules as of 12/28/25 to make it look good)
